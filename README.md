---

### 6. [Recommended] Secure Your Panel with HTTPS (Nginx + Certbot)

> **This is the recommended and secure way to access your panel.**  
> By default, the Pterodactyl panel runs over HTTP. To protect your login and data, enable HTTPS using a free SSL certificate from Let‚Äôs Encrypt.

#### Step 1: Point Your Domain

Create an **A record** in your DNS provider (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, etc.):

```
panel.yourdomain.com ‚Üí <your-server-ip>
```

Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation.

#### Step 2: Install Certbot

Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

#### Step 3: Obtain and Apply SSL Certificate

Run:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d panel.yourdomain.com
```

-   Agree to the terms.
-   Enter your email.
-   Choose to redirect HTTP to HTTPS when prompted.

#### Step 4: Enable Auto-Renewal

Certificates renew automatically every 90 days, but enable the timer to ensure this:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable certbot.timer
sudo systemctl start certbot.timer
```

---

**Done!**  
Now your panel is securely accessible via(https):

```
https://panel.yourdomain.com
```

---

### 7. Log In to Your Pterodactyl Panel

Open your browser and go to your secure panel URL:

```
https://panel.yourdomain.com
```

Log in with the **admin email/username and password you set during installation**.
